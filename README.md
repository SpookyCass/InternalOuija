# Internal-Ouija
Digital Divination tool for class

## About
For this assignment, I wanted to create a digital Ouija board that functions how a real ouija board does, according to the scientific explanation. This being the logic that the user is controlling the planchette, not ghostly spirits, and it is their subconscious answering the questions that they ask. I wanted to make this idea because I think it is a good way to actually access your subconscious to get the real answers to your questions that you may not get if you ask yourself how you usually would. I don't explain this logic on the site itself, because I want it to be interpreted by the user based on their personal beliefs of what they think the purpose of this Ouija board is to them.

## Process
I started with some rough sketches of the layout I was thinking.

As seen in the second photo, I planned out how I would use flex boxes to get the layout I wanted, as well as color ideas and art I would include.

## Challenges
I used javaScript to make the letters be clickable buttons, but had to do research to learn how to do this in a more efficient way than making an individual button for each letter, so I figured out how to do this in my code through trial and error as well as the research. I wanted the planchette circle to be right where the mouse is so it clicks on the letter inside of the circle, but I couldn't figure out how to adjust the positioning there, something I need to get back to later. I did that with javaScript code as well and am still struggling. With the layout, I worked it out using flexboxes to make the board with html and css rather than just importing a picture and using mapping, which I considered, but think that would've been harder.
