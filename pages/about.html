          <h2>My Board</h2>
              <p class="about">Ouija board's are traditionally seen as a communication device across planes from reality to the spirit world. With my board design seen on this site, I wanted to tap into the scientific explanation of how Ouija boards work, which is explained with the fact that the users of the board place their hands on the planchette, and it is moved to answer their questions based on their subconscious. I cannot say whether or not I believe the classic, spiritual explanation that the energy of the spirit moves the planchette or not, but I am interested in this scientific take. People's subconscious' can be hard to access, so, to have a tool that can allow them to access this without their knowledge can be quite useful to truly answering their questions. </p>
          <h2>The Classic Ouija Board</h2>
             <p class="about">As previously mentioned, Ouija Boards have been used  to contact "the other side," meaning it is used as a communication device for spirits in the location it is being used. The process consists of lighting candles and focusing your energy on the board, typicially this is done with a group of people who all "believe" that the Ouija board will actually work, or it wont. People also say you should <em>never</em> do it alone, which is why there will typically be a group using it. Next, everyone places two fingers lightly on the planchette, close thier eyes and moves the planchette in a circle three times in the center of the board, and asks "Are there any spirits who wish to speak with us?" or something along those lines. The users wait, and likely the planchette will go over to the word "YES" to answer. Next they can ask any question they want, whether that is a personal question of thiers, which wouldn't be useful since spirits are not omnicient and likely wouldn't know any personal information of the users, unless it was a relative that had passed that the users were attempting to contact. They could also ask the spirit any question they wanted to know about it such as "How old are you?," "What is your name?," or anything of that nature. When the users finish asking all of their questions and want to end the session, it is important to <em>always</em> drag the planchette down to the word "GOODBYE" to close the communication to the other side. If you don't do this, you could risk leaving this passage open for spirits to roam in your life or space, which is not desired.</p>
        <br>
             <p class="about"> Supposedly, if the planchette starts making a figure 8 shape on the board or goes across all of the letters, the board is being controlled by an evil spirit, possibly one by the name of "Zozo," who has been known as the Ouija Board demon. If this happens, users should immediately drag the planchette to the word "GOODBYE" to close the session. That being said, Ouija boards are <strong>NOT</strong> inherently evil as some people may assume, and are intended as harmless devices for contacting spirits of any kind, the intentions of the user is the only thing that could make it be used for evil.</p>
